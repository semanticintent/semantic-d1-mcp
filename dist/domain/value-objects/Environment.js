 * - "development" semantically means: testing, experimentation, safe to modify
 * - "staging" semantically means: pre-production validation, production-like
 * - "production" semantically means: live data, critical operations, read-carefully
 *
 * IMMUTABILITY: Value objects are immutable by design
 * OBSERVABLE: Environment is directly observable from configuration/context
